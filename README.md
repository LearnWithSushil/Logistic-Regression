# Regularized Logistic Regression

This project implements logistic regression and applies it to two different datasets. The main goal is to build a logistic regression model to predict outcomes based on given features and demonstrate the application of regularized logistic regression.

## Overview

This project involves:
- Implementing the logistic regression model.
- Applying it to datasets to predict binary outcomes.
- Extending the model to include regularization to prevent overfitting.
- Visualizing the decision boundary of the model.
- Evaluating the model's performance.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (numpy, matplotlib)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/regularized-logistic-regression.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd regularized-logistic-regression
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the `Logistic_Regression.ipynb` notebook.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each cell and observe the outputs.
